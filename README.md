# deploy_cluster
Easily deploy clusters of 2+ nodes with highly available Postgresql. This tool 
is meant to help deploying clusters quickly and reliably in a replicable manner. 

It includes a modified Python translation of 
[PAF](https://github.com/dalibo/PAF), a multi-state Pacemaker Resource Agent 
(RA) for Postgresql.

There are some unit tests and functional tests (eg test PG replication, test 
killing-adding back a slave, test "pcs stanby/unstandby" a slave), but more 
tests are needed to confirm the RA works properly in most scenarios.

# Requirements:

- Linux or Windows
- VirtualBox
- Python >= 3.6 
- Python module Paramiko (python -m pip install paramiko)

# Usage

1. Set up a VirtualBox VM that has:
    - CentOS/RHEL 7, Debian 9, or Ubuntu Zesty
    - SELinux disabled
    - VirtualBox guest additions
    - Postgresql 9.6 
    - pcs enabled (disable corosync and pacemaker services)
    - Enable root account (when using Ubuntu)
    
1. Export the VM as an OVA file 
    
1. Update the JSON cluster file as needed (config\cluster.json)

1. Deploy the cluster: 
   
        python deployer\app.py config\cluster.json

# TODO

- Untangle code by eliminating all calls to get_ocf_state.

- Perhaps the RA could try to clean up a crashed master instance by starting 
it and shutting it down

- RA should (optionally ?) report a non replicating slave as down. This can 
possibly be done with replication slots and inspecting the ouptut of 
            
        SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots
             
- RA should block slave instances that fail to stream from Master, at least 
with timeline fork issues, eg:
	
        LOG:  fetching timeline history file for timeline 3 from primary server
        FATAL:  could not start WAL streaming: ERROR:  requested starting point 0/9000000 
        on timeline 2 is not in this server's history
        DETAIL:  This server's history forked from timeline 2 at 0/80001A8.

- Make deployer work on QEMU and VMWare.
